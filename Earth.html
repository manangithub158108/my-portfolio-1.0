        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About 
        29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is covered 
        with water, mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers and other fresh water, which together constitute 
        the hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic 
        ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid 
        tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. Earth's interior remains 
        active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a 
        convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.

        Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only 
        natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365.25 days. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with 
        respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the 
        Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the
        densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets.

        According to radiometric dating estimation and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. 
        Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect Earth's 
        atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic organisms. Some 
        geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as early as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the 
        combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties and geological history have allowed life to 
        evolve and thrive.

        In the history of life on Earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally 
        punctuated by mass extinctions. Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Estimates of 
        the number of species on Earth today vary widely; most species have not been described. Almost 8 billion 
        humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival. Humans increasingly 
        impact Earth's hydrology, atmospheric processes and other life.
