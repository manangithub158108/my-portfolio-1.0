        Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the 
        fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 
        17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and 
        physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its 
        atmosphere. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU 
        (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical 
        symbol â™†, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.

        Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with 
        traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, though it contains a higher proportion of "ices" such as 
        water, ammonia and methane. However, similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and 
        rock;[19] Uranus and Neptune are normally considered "ice giants" to emphasise this distinction. 
        Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance.

        Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by 
        mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus 
        led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown 
        planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations, 
        independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a 
        telescope on 23 September 1846
