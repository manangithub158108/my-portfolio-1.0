      <h3> On based upon this picture there is a descriptive introduction about a solar system :-</h3>
      
     <p>
        The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, 
        either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the 
        eight planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System 
        bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the moons—two are larger than the smallest 
        planet, Mercury.
      </p>  

      <p>
        The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar 
        molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining 
        mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are 
        terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant 
        planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest planets, Jupiter and 
        Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus 
        and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points 
        compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight 
        planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The Solar System also contains smaller objects. The asteroid belt, which lies between 
        the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of 
        rock and metal. Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, which are populations 
        of trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population of 
        sednoids. Within these populations, some objects are large enough to have rounded under their own 
        gravity, though there is considerable debate as to how many there will prove to be. Such objects 
        are categorized as dwarf planets. The only certain dwarf planet is Pluto, with another trans-Neptunian 
        object, Eris, expected to be, and the asteroid Ceres at least close to being a dwarf planet. 
        In addition to these two regions, various other small-body populations, including comets, centaurs and 
        interplanetary dust clouds, freely travel between regions. Six of the planets, the six largest possible 
        dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites, usually termed "moons" 
        after the Moon. Each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small objects.
