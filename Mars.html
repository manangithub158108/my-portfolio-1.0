        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being 
        larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often 
        referred to as the "Red Planet".[17][18] The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent 
        on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies 
        visible to the naked eye.[19] Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface 
        features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps 
        of Earth.

        The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as the tilt of 
        the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest 
        volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the 
        largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the 
        planet and may be a giant impact feature.[20][21] Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and 
        irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.

        Mars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft. Mariner 4 was the first spacecraft to visit Mars; 
        launched by NASA on 28 November 1964, it made its closest approach to the planet on 15 July 1965. Mariner 4 
        detected the weak Martian radiation belt, measured at about 0.1% that of Earth, and captured the first images
        of another planet from deep space.

        There are investigations assessing the past habitability of Mars, as well as the possibility of extant life. 
        Astrobiology missions are planned, including the Perseverance and Rosalind Franklin rovers. Liquid water on 
        the surface of Mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the atmospheric 
        pressure on Earth, except at the lowest elevations for short periods. The two polar ice caps appear to be 
        made largely of water.[38][39] The volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap, if melted, would be 
        sufficient to cover the planetary surface to a depth of 11 metres (36 ft).[40] In November 2016, NASA 
        reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region. The volume of water 
        detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior.

        Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. Its apparent magnitude 
        reaches âˆ’2.94, which is surpassed only by Venus, the Moon and the Sun.[13] Optical ground-based telescopes 
        are typically limited to resolving features about 300 kilometres (190 mi) across when Earth and Mars are 
        closest because of Earth's atmosphere
